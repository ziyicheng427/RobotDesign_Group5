# Manchester Uni Robotic Systems Design Project Team5 (AERO62520)

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Manchester Robotics Team5! We are a group of four passionate Robotics postgraduate students from the University of Manchester: Alexander Morley, Michalis Iacovides, Geetik Mamillapalli, and Ziyi Cheng.

This repository serves as our collaborative workspace for developing an innovative robotics project. Our primary objective is to create a robot capable of autonomously picking up objects from the environment.

## Project Overview

The project aims to design and implement a robotic system that combines the mobility of the LeoRover with the functionality of a mechanical arm. This system will be equipped with sensors and AI algorithms to detect, approach, and manipulate objects in various settings.

### Key Features(To be completed)

- **Autonomous Navigation:** 
- **Object Detection:**
